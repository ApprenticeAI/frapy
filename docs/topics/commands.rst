.. _topics-commands:

=================
Command line tool
=================

Frapy is controlled through the ``frapy`` command-line tool, to be referred
here as the "Frapy tool" to differentiate it from the sub-commands, which we
just call "commands" or "Frapy commands".

The Frapy tool provides several commands, for multiple purposes, and each one
accepts a different set of arguments and options.

(The ``frapy deploy`` command has been removed in 1.0 in favor of the
standalone ``frapyd-deploy``. See `Deploying your project`_.)

.. _topics-config-settings:

Configuration settings
======================

Frapy will look for configuration parameters in ini-style ``frapy.cfg`` files
in standard locations:

1. ``/etc/frapy.cfg`` or ``c:\frapy\frapy.cfg`` (system-wide),
2. ``~/.config/frapy.cfg`` (``$XDG_CONFIG_HOME``) and ``~/.frapy.cfg`` (``$HOME``)
   for global (user-wide) settings, and
3. ``frapy.cfg`` inside a Frapy project's root (see next section).

Settings from these files are merged in the listed order of preference:
user-defined values have higher priority than system-wide defaults
and project-wide settings will override all others, when defined.

Frapy also understands, and can be configured through, a number of environment
variables. Currently these are:

* ``FRAPY_SETTINGS_MODULE`` (see :ref:`topics-settings-module-envvar`)
* ``FRAPY_PROJECT`` (see :ref:`topics-project-envvar`)
* ``FRAPY_PYTHON_SHELL`` (see :ref:`topics-shell`)

.. _topics-project-structure:

Default structure of Frapy projects
====================================

Before delving into the command-line tool and its sub-commands, let's first
understand the directory structure of a Frapy project.

Though it can be modified, all Frapy projects have the same file
structure by default, similar to this::

   frapy.cfg
   myproject/
       __init__.py
       items.py
       middlewares.py
       pipelines.py
       settings.py
       spiders/
           __init__.py
           spider1.py
           spider2.py
           ...

The directory where the ``frapy.cfg`` file resides is known as the *project
root directory*. That file contains the name of the python module that defines
the project settings. Here is an example:

.. code-block:: ini

    [settings]
    default = myproject.settings

.. _topics-project-envvar:

Sharing the root directory between projects
===========================================

A project root directory, the one that contains the ``frapy.cfg``, may be
shared by multiple Frapy projects, each with its own settings module.

In that case, you must define one or more aliases for those settings modules
under ``[settings]`` in your ``frapy.cfg`` file:

.. code-block:: ini

    [settings]
    default = myproject1.settings
    project1 = myproject1.settings
    project2 = myproject2.settings

By default, the ``frapy`` command-line tool will use the ``default`` settings.
Use the ``FRAPY_PROJECT`` environment variable to specify a different project
for ``frapy`` to use::

    $ frapy settings --get BOT_NAME
    Project 1 Bot
    $ export FRAPY_PROJECT=project2
    $ frapy settings --get BOT_NAME
    Project 2 Bot


Using the ``frapy`` tool
=========================

You can start by running the Frapy tool with no arguments and it will print
some usage help and the available commands::

    Frapy X.Y - no active project

    Usage:
      frapy <command> [options] [args]

    Available commands:
      crawl         Run a spider
      fetch         Fetch a URL using the Frapy downloader
    [...]

The first line will print the currently active project if you're inside a
Frapy project. In this example it was run from outside a project. If run from inside
a project it would have printed something like this::

    Frapy X.Y - project: myproject

    Usage:
      frapy <command> [options] [args]

    [...]

Creating projects
-----------------

The first thing you typically do with the ``frapy`` tool is create your Frapy
project::

    frapy startproject myproject [project_dir]

That will create a Frapy project under the ``project_dir`` directory.
If ``project_dir`` wasn't specified, ``project_dir`` will be the same as ``myproject``.

Next, you go inside the new project directory::

    cd project_dir

And you're ready to use the ``frapy`` command to manage and control your
project from there.

Controlling projects
--------------------

You use the ``frapy`` tool from inside your projects to control and manage
them.

For example, to create a new spider::

    frapy genspider mydomain mydomain.com

Some Frapy commands (like :command:`crawl`) must be run from inside a Frapy
project. See the :ref:`commands reference <topics-commands-ref>` below for more
information on which commands must be run from inside projects, and which not.

Also keep in mind that some commands may have slightly different behaviours
when running them from inside projects. For example, the fetch command will use
spider-overridden behaviours (such as the ``user_agent`` attribute to override
the user-agent) if the url being fetched is associated with some specific
spider. This is intentional, as the ``fetch`` command is meant to be used to
check how spiders are downloading pages.

.. _topics-commands-ref:

Available tool commands
=======================

This section contains a list of the available built-in commands with a
description and some usage examples. Remember, you can always get more info
about each command by running::

    frapy <command> -h

And you can see all available commands with::

    frapy -h

There are two kinds of commands, those that only work from inside a Frapy
project (Project-specific commands) and those that also work without an active
Frapy project (Global commands), though they may behave slightly different
when running from inside a project (as they would use the project overridden
settings).

Global commands:

* :command:`startproject`
* :command:`genspider`
* :command:`settings`
* :command:`runspider`
* :command:`shell`
* :command:`fetch`
* :command:`view`
* :command:`version`

Project-only commands:

* :command:`crawl`
* :command:`check`
* :command:`list`
* :command:`edit`
* :command:`parse`
* :command:`bench`

.. command:: startproject

startproject
------------

* Syntax: ``frapy startproject <project_name> [project_dir]``
* Requires project: *no*

Creates a new Frapy project named ``project_name``, under the ``project_dir``
directory.
If ``project_dir`` wasn't specified, ``project_dir`` will be the same as ``project_name``.

Usage example::

    $ frapy startproject myproject

.. command:: genspider

genspider
---------

* Syntax: ``frapy genspider [-t template] <name> <domain or URL>``
* Requires project: *no*

.. versionadded:: 2.6.0
   The ability to pass a URL instead of a domain.

Create a new spider in the current folder or in the current project's ``spiders`` folder, if called from inside a project. The ``<name>`` parameter is set as the spider's ``name``, while ``<domain or URL>`` is used to generate the ``allowed_domains`` and ``start_urls`` spider's attributes.

Usage example::

    $ frapy genspider -l
    Available templates:
      basic
      crawl
      csvfeed
      xmlfeed

    $ frapy genspider example example.com
    Created spider 'example' using template 'basic'

    $ frapy genspider -t crawl frapyorg frapy.org
    Created spider 'frapyorg' using template 'crawl'

This is just a convenience shortcut command for creating spiders based on
pre-defined templates, but certainly not the only way to create spiders. You
can just create the spider source code files yourself, instead of using this
command.

.. command:: crawl

crawl
-----

* Syntax: ``frapy crawl <spider>``
* Requires project: *yes*

Start crawling using a spider.

Supported options:

* ``-h, --help``: show a help message and exit

* ``-a NAME=VALUE``: set a spider argument (may be repeated)

* ``--output FILE`` or ``-o FILE``: append scraped items to the end of FILE (use - for stdout), to define format set a colon at the end of the output URI (i.e. ``-o FILE:FORMAT``)

* ``--overwrite-output FILE`` or ``-O FILE``: dump scraped items into FILE, overwriting any existing file, to define format set a colon at the end of the output URI (i.e. ``-O FILE:FORMAT``)

* ``--output-format FORMAT`` or ``-t FORMAT``: deprecated way to define format to use for dumping items, does not work in combination with ``-O``

Usage examples::

    $ frapy crawl myspider
    [ ... myspider starts crawling ... ]

    $ frapy -o myfile:csv myspider
    [ ... myspider starts crawling and appends the result to the file myfile in csv format ... ]

    $ frapy -O myfile:json myspider
    [ ... myspider starts crawling and saves the result in myfile in json format overwriting the original content... ]

    $ frapy -o myfile -t csv myspider
    [ ... myspider starts crawling and appends the result to the file myfile in csv format ... ]

.. command:: check

check
-----

* Syntax: ``frapy check [-l] <spider>``
* Requires project: *yes*

Run contract checks.

.. skip: start

Usage examples::

    $ frapy check -l
    first_spider
      * parse
      * parse_item
    second_spider
      * parse
      * parse_item

    $ frapy check
    [FAILED] first_spider:parse_item
    >>> 'RetailPricex' field is missing

    [FAILED] first_spider:parse
    >>> Returned 92 requests, expected 0..4

.. skip: end

.. command:: list

list
----

* Syntax: ``frapy list``
* Requires project: *yes*

List all available spiders in the current project. The output is one spider per
line.

Usage example::

    $ frapy list
    spider1
    spider2

.. command:: edit

edit
----

* Syntax: ``frapy edit <spider>``
* Requires project: *yes*

Edit the given spider using the editor defined in the ``EDITOR`` environment
variable or (if unset) the :setting:`EDITOR` setting.

This command is provided only as a convenience shortcut for the most common
case, the developer is of course free to choose any tool or IDE to write and
debug spiders.

Usage example::

    $ frapy edit spider1

.. command:: fetch

fetch
-----

* Syntax: ``frapy fetch <url>``
* Requires project: *no*

Downloads the given URL using the Frapy downloader and writes the contents to
standard output.

The interesting thing about this command is that it fetches the page how the
spider would download it. For example, if the spider has a ``USER_AGENT``
attribute which overrides the User Agent, it will use that one.

So this command can be used to "see" how your spider would fetch a certain page.

If used outside a project, no particular per-spider behaviour would be applied
and it will just use the default Frapy downloader settings.

Supported options:

* ``--spider=SPIDER``: bypass spider autodetection and force use of specific spider

* ``--headers``: print the response's HTTP headers instead of the response's body

* ``--no-redirect``: do not follow HTTP 3xx redirects (default is to follow them)

Usage examples::

    $ frapy fetch --nolog http://www.example.com/some/page.html
    [ ... html content here ... ]

    $ frapy fetch --nolog --headers http://www.example.com/
    {'Accept-Ranges': ['bytes'],
     'Age': ['1263   '],
     'Connection': ['close     '],
     'Content-Length': ['596'],
     'Content-Type': ['text/html; charset=UTF-8'],
     'Date': ['Wed, 18 Aug 2010 23:59:46 GMT'],
     'Etag': ['"573c1-254-48c9c87349680"'],
     'Last-Modified': ['Fri, 30 Jul 2010 15:30:18 GMT'],
     'Server': ['Apache/2.2.3 (CentOS)']}

.. command:: view

view
----

* Syntax: ``frapy view <url>``
* Requires project: *no*

Opens the given URL in a browser, as your Frapy spider would "see" it.
Sometimes spiders see pages differently from regular users, so this can be used
to check what the spider "sees" and confirm it's what you expect.

Supported options:

* ``--spider=SPIDER``: bypass spider autodetection and force use of specific spider

* ``--no-redirect``: do not follow HTTP 3xx redirects (default is to follow them)

Usage example::

    $ frapy view http://www.example.com/some/page.html
    [ ... browser starts ... ]

.. command:: shell

shell
-----

* Syntax: ``frapy shell [url]``
* Requires project: *no*

Starts the Frapy shell for the given URL (if given) or empty if no URL is
given. Also supports UNIX-style local file paths, either relative with
``./`` or ``../`` prefixes or absolute file paths.
See :ref:`topics-shell` for more info.

Supported options:

* ``--spider=SPIDER``: bypass spider autodetection and force use of specific spider

* ``-c code``: evaluate the code in the shell, print the result and exit

* ``--no-redirect``: do not follow HTTP 3xx redirects (default is to follow them);
  this only affects the URL you may pass as argument on the command line;
  once you are inside the shell, ``fetch(url)`` will still follow HTTP redirects by default.

Usage example::

    $ frapy shell http://www.example.com/some/page.html
    [ ... frapy shell starts ... ]

    $ frapy shell --nolog http://www.example.com/ -c '(response.status, response.url)'
    (200, 'http://www.example.com/')

    # shell follows HTTP redirects by default
    $ frapy shell --nolog http://httpbin.org/redirect-to?url=http%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2F -c '(response.status, response.url)'
    (200, 'http://example.com/')

    # you can disable this with --no-redirect
    # (only for the URL passed as command line argument)
    $ frapy shell --no-redirect --nolog http://httpbin.org/redirect-to?url=http%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2F -c '(response.status, response.url)'
    (302, 'http://httpbin.org/redirect-to?url=http%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2F')


.. command:: parse

parse
-----

* Syntax: ``frapy parse <url> [options]``
* Requires project: *yes*

Fetches the given URL and parses it with the spider that handles it, using the
method passed with the ``--callback`` option, or ``parse`` if not given.

Supported options:

* ``--spider=SPIDER``: bypass spider autodetection and force use of specific spider

* ``--a NAME=VALUE``: set spider argument (may be repeated)

* ``--callback`` or ``-c``: spider method to use as callback for parsing the
  response

* ``--meta`` or ``-m``: additional request meta that will be passed to the callback
  request. This must be a valid json string. Example: --meta='{"foo" : "bar"}'

* ``--cbkwargs``: additional keyword arguments that will be passed to the callback.
  This must be a valid json string. Example: --cbkwargs='{"foo" : "bar"}'

* ``--pipelines``: process items through pipelines

* ``--rules`` or ``-r``: use :class:`~frapy.spiders.CrawlSpider`
  rules to discover the callback (i.e. spider method) to use for parsing the
  response

* ``--noitems``: don't show scraped items

* ``--nolinks``: don't show extracted links

* ``--nocolour``: avoid using pygments to colorize the output

* ``--depth`` or ``-d``: depth level for which the requests should be followed
  recursively (default: 1)

* ``--verbose`` or ``-v``: display information for each depth level

* ``--output`` or ``-o``: dump scraped items to a file

  .. versionadded:: 2.3

.. skip: start

Usage example::

    $ frapy parse http://www.example.com/ -c parse_item
    [ ... frapy log lines crawling example.com spider ... ]

    >>> STATUS DEPTH LEVEL 1 <<<
    # Scraped Items  ------------------------------------------------------------
    [{'name': 'Example item',
     'category': 'Furniture',
     'length': '12 cm'}]

    # Requests  -----------------------------------------------------------------
    []

.. skip: end


.. command:: settings

settings
--------

* Syntax: ``frapy settings [options]``
* Requires project: *no*

Get the value of a Frapy setting.

If used inside a project it'll show the project setting value, otherwise it'll
show the default Frapy value for that setting.

Example usage::

    $ frapy settings --get BOT_NAME
    frapybot
    $ frapy settings --get DOWNLOAD_DELAY
    0

.. command:: runspider

runspider
---------

* Syntax: ``frapy runspider <spider_file.py>``
* Requires project: *no*

Run a spider self-contained in a Python file, without having to create a
project.

Example usage::

    $ frapy runspider myspider.py
    [ ... spider starts crawling ... ]

.. command:: version

version
-------

* Syntax: ``frapy version [-v]``
* Requires project: *no*

Prints the Frapy version. If used with ``-v`` it also prints Python, Twisted
and Platform info, which is useful for bug reports.

.. command:: bench

bench
-----

* Syntax: ``frapy bench``
* Requires project: *no*

Run a quick benchmark test. :ref:`benchmarking`.

Custom project commands
=======================

You can also add your custom project commands by using the
:setting:`COMMANDS_MODULE` setting. See the Frapy commands in
`frapy/commands`_ for examples on how to implement your commands.

.. _frapy/commands: https://github.com/frapy/frapy/tree/master/frapy/commands
.. setting:: COMMANDS_MODULE

COMMANDS_MODULE
---------------

Default: ``''`` (empty string)

A module to use for looking up custom Frapy commands. This is used to add custom
commands for your Frapy project.

Example:

.. code-block:: python

    COMMANDS_MODULE = "mybot.commands"

.. _Deploying your project: https://frapyd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/deploy.html

Register commands via setup.py entry points
-------------------------------------------

You can also add Frapy commands from an external library by adding a
``frapy.commands`` section in the entry points of the library ``setup.py``
file.

The following example adds ``my_command`` command:

.. skip: next

.. code-block:: python

  from setuptools import setup, find_packages

  setup(
      name="frapy-mymodule",
      entry_points={
          "frapy.commands": [
              "my_command=my_frapy_module.commands:MyCommand",
          ],
      },
  )
